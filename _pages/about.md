I'm a Ph.D. student of [Computational Imaging Technology & Engineering Lab](https://cite.nju.edu.cn) at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/). I'm currently focus on the research of humanoid robot motion imitation and real-time teleoperation.

Research
======
My research interests include human motion capture, motion understanding, human-robot interaction, humanoid robot motion control, and teleoperation. 

Project
======
More details can be available at [MoCapHumanoid](https://shenqiu.njucite.cn/MoCapHumanoid/) and [Github](https://github.com/NJU-CITE-MoCapHumanoid). We look forward to your joining us and growing together. Experience with Python, PyTorch, Linux, and ROS would be a plus.
