I'm a Ph.D. student of [Computational Imaging Technology & Engineering Lab](https://cite.nju.edu.cn) at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/). My research interests include human motion capture, motion understanding, human-robot interaction, humanoid robot motion control, and teleoperation.
